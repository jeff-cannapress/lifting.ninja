This project is implmented inside a development container in order to use the project you will need to install:

We adhere to git best practice by utilizing branches and pull-requests. You will be unable to push changes directly to the `main` branch. Instead you must create a branch with a relevent name like `feature/123-description` push that branch up to github and submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
